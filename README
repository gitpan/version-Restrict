NAME
    version::Restrict - Control permitted versions that can be use'd

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    In your module (you don't want users using version "v" where "0.0.0 <= v
    < 1.0.0" or "2.2.4 <= v < 2.3.1"):

     package YourModule;
     use version::Restrict (
         "[0.0.0,1.0.0)" => "constructor syntax has changed",
         "[2.2.4,2.3.1)" => "frobniz method croaks without second argument",
     );

    Now your module users will die when they write:

     use YourModule;       # no version specified
     use YourModule 0.0.1; # contructor syntax has changed
     use YourModule 2.2.5; # frobniz method croaks without second argument

    But any of these are OK:

     use YourModule 1.0.0;
     use YourModule 2.4.1;

DESCRIPTION
    Status: experimental/proof-of-concept.

    This module is like version::Limit, but with a different interface (you
    specify restricted versions in the "use" statement) and a different
    behavior (if v0.0.0 is in one of the restricted versions, your module
    user must specify desired version of your module explicitly, otherwise
    they will die).

    This module works by installing a "VERSION()" method to your module.
    This method will be called by Perl when your module user use's your
    module with specified version, e.g. "use YourModule 0.123;".

    Additionally, this module will also install (or wrap) an "import()"
    method to your module. The task of this method is to check whether
    "VERSION()" has been called via checking a flag variable. We require
    "VERSION()" to be run if one of the restricted versions is "v0.0.0",
    meaning that you don't want your module users to just say "use
    YourModule;" (without specifying explicit version). After that, the
    installed "import()" method just passes control to the original import
    method.
